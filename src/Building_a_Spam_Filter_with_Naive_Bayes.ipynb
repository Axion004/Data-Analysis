    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this project is to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from [this repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). \n",
    "\n",
    "To classify messages as spam or non-spam, the computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learns how humans classify messages.\n",
    "- Uses that knowledge to estimate probabilities for new messages being spam or non-spam.\n",
    "- Classifies a new message based on these values: \n",
    "     - the probability for spam is greater — spam,\n",
    "     - the probability for non-spam is greater — non-spam,\n",
    "     - the two probability values are equal — we may need a human to classify the message.\n",
    "     \n",
    "In other words, our task for this project is to \"teach\" the computer how to classify messages. "

    "### Summary of Results\n",
    "We created a highly accurate spam filter, managing to reach the accuracy of 98.83%, which is almost 20% higher than our initial focus. A few messages classified incorrectly revealed some features in common. The attempt to increase the accuracy even further by making the algorithm sensitive to letter case resulted in just the opposite, rendering the spam filter 13.5% less efficient."

First off, let's randomize the entire dataset. This will ensure that spam and ham messages are spread properly. "

    "In this project, we created a highly accurate spam filter based on the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and a dataset of labeled 5,572 SMS. The spam filter takes in a new message and classifies it as spam or ham. We managed to reach an accuracy of 98.74%, which is almost 20% higher than our initial focus. Below are some additional conclusions and insights from this project:\n",
    "-\tA few messages classified incorrectly have some features in common. False spam messages tend to be very short, have the words absent in the vocabulary, contain typical spam-like words, or neutral words previously detected, by coincidence, only in spam messages. False ham messages tend to be rather long and have a high percentage of neutral words or the words absent in the vocabulary. In the undefined messages, we can expect an approximately proportional mixture of neutral and spam-like words.\n",
    "-\tThe attempt to increase the accuracy even further by making the algorithm sensitive to letter case resulted, just the opposite, in rendering the spam filter much less efficient, with the accuracy dropped by 13.5%. It seems that the letter case doesn't make any valuable difference when it comes to distinguishing between spam and ham messages. \n",
    "-\tThe 100 most popular meaningful spam-prone words revealed the following patterns: encouraging people to do further actions, promising them something alluring, urging them, having sexual context, inviting to visit some web resources, advertising various digital devices and products."
