    "- Regarding the new record label, the company should make the best out of genres with high popularity in the US. They should select Hip-Hop, Punk, and Pop from the current options. Chinook should also be on the lookout for Rock songs since they account for the USA's most significant sales (53%).\n",

    "- Jane Peacock is Chinook's best-performing salesperson. Steve Johnson appears to be underperforming in total sales, but this is only because he joined four months later than the others.\n",

    "- US and Canada have the most extensive customer base, but customers spend less per transaction. The Czech Republic, India, and Portugal have the highest spending customers. Chinook could launch a marketing campaign to increase the customer base in the three regions.\n",

    "- The plan to focus only on popular tracks may sound viable. However, it risks losing revenue from customers who prefer entire albums. It is better to conduct surveys and gather customer perspectives before implementing any new plan."
